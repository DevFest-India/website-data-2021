Without any second thought, I said YES. Because I liked the community concept and being an organizer I can help many people who need help like me. And the part I like most is networking, because we will come to know what community needs and in which way we can help our community best. Whenever I speak to my colleagues and I come to know that they are struggling with some things that the community can help with, I will try my best to connect them with concerned persons so that they can happily solve their problem.
